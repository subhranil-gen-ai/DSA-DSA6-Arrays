# DSA-DSA6-Arrays
Python solutions for string manipulation problems as part of Day 6 in the DSA Practice Series. Includes core problems like reversing strings, checking palindromes, and counting vowels/consonants — along with bonus challenges such as detecting unique characters, replacing vowels, and finding the most frequent character

# Core Problems:
- Reverse a string using loop and slicing
- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Count vowels and consonants
- Remove all spaces from a string
- Check if two strings are anagrams
- Frequency of character in string
- Count the occurrence of a specific character
- Convert lowercase to uppercase using ASCII
- Check if all characters are unique
- Replace all vowels with *
- Find the most frequent character in a string

# 📚 Concepts Practiced
String reversal, palindrome check, vowel/consonant count, space removal, anagram check, ASCII conversion, unique char check, vowel replacement, and most frequent char.
